Final Project 2 - Contact Book Python Program 
Original code - https://www.studytonight.com/python-projects/contact-book-python-project?fbclid=IwAR1O_pXrJgE86UqZJA6xDkEawyBf290IFA__kxcZp0g93CES8-pp5T3rYHM

Description and Modifications: 
This is a program that allows the user to manage a Contact Book. It provides the user with a menu of options to perform various operations like adding a contact, searching for a contact, deleting a contact, and sorting the phone directory using different sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort.

The Contact Book is implemented using two separate lists: one for storing the names of the contacts, and another for storing their phone numbers. When the program starts, the user is prompted to enter the names and phone numbers of several contacts.

The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly prompts the user to choose an operation from the menu. Depending on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding operation like adding a contact, searching for a contact, deleting a contact, or sorting the phone directory using the selected sorting algorithm.

The implementation of the sorting algorithms is provided as separate functions that take the list of names as an input and sort it in place. The print_directory() function is used to print the entire Contact Book with the names and phone numbers aligned in columns.

Overall, this program provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for managing a contacts, and demonstrates the use of various sorting algorithms to sort a list of data.
